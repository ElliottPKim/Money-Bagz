# Money-Bagz

## Description

We as a group made a SportsBook website to be able to see matchups and odds for given sport/team.
No betting or gambling features whatsoever have been implemented. This is purley information.
This project shows a user recent matches and betting odds of their favorite sports team to allow them to have more realistic bets if they wish to place them on a seperate website.
Things learned include:
[ ] Utilizing server side API's to render information on a website
[ ] Utilizing third party API's to allow for coding to reach a finished product sooner
[ ] Securing better github knowledge to be able to work with people in the future 

## Usage

A user will be prompted upon arrival to the website with a modal reminding them that gambling is not allowed on this website.
On the top of the screen the user will see a headline for the most current sports news, if the api responds with an error the user will see a randomly generated Chuck Norris joke.
They will then be able to access their favorite sport and team by clicking on the sport they like, followed by the team they like.
As of now the only sport and team that are working on this website is 'Basketball' followed by 'Los Angeles Lakers'.
If a sport or team that is not functioning is clicked on, the user will be prompted with a modal that will tell them the feature is coming soon.
After accessing a functiong sport and team the user will see all their games for the season displayed and odds for the most recent played game.
A user can save a team as their favorite within local storage and the current time of their next game will be displayed after the page has been refreshed.
A user can clear their local storage with a button to allow the home page to revert to normal.
