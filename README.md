# Money-Bagz

## Description

We as a group made a SportsBook website to be able to see matchups and odds for given sport/team.
No betting or gambling features whatsoever have been implemented. This is purley information.
This project shows a user recent matches and betting odds of their favorite sports team to allow them to have more realistic bets if they wish to place them on a seperate website.<br>
Things learned include:<br>
[ ] Utilizing server side API's to render information on a website<br>
[ ] Utilizing third party API's to allow for coding to reach a finished product sooner<br>
[ ] Securing better github knowledge to be able to work with people in the future

## Usage

A user will be prompted upon arrival to the website with a modal reminding them that gambling is not allowed on this website.<br>
On the top of the screen the user will see a headline for the most current sports news, if the api responds with an error the user will see a randomly generated Chuck Norris joke.<br>
They will then be able to access their favorite sport and team by clicking on the sport they like, followed by the team they like.<br>
As of now the only sport and team that are working on this website is 'Basketball' followed by 'Los Angeles Lakers'.<br>
If a sport or team that is not functioning is clicked on, the user will be prompted with a modal that will tell them the feature is coming soon.<br>
After accessing a functiong sport and team the user will see all their games for the season displayed and odds for the most recent played game.<br>
A user can save a team as their favorite within local storage and the current time of their next game will be displayed after the page has been refreshed.<br>
A user can clear their local storage with a button to allow the home page to revert to normal.
